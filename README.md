# Overview of My Project Experience

First, I chose to build this project using [Nuxt.js](https://nuxt.com/) after being inspired by the [ColdBanana website](https://www.coldbanana.com/). I focused on implementing DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) and atomic design principles to create a modular, maintainable codebase, ensuring best practices throughout the development process. This project includes features such as dynamic loading, responsiveness, and reusable components.

## Key Features

**Dynamic Loading:** Efficiently loads content on demand to improve performance.

**Responsive Design:** Fully responsive layout for an optimal viewing experience across devices.

**Atomic Components:** Components are designed for reusability, promoting consistency and reducing redundancy.


## Technologies Used

**Nuxt.js** 

**Vue.js** 

**HTML/CSS**

**JavaScript**
